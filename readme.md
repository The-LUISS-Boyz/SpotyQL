Welcome! This is our ultimate SQL project.

## Insights

We've decided to add a frontend interface, trying to merge all teachings we've gotten so far.

This project assembles together teachings from:

- digital skills lab
- Databases & Big Data

## How to execute

There is no need to install dependencies or initialize virtual environments.

To execute the project, just load the 'startup.py' script as follows:

<code>python startup.py .env</code>

2. Install dependencies from application/requirements.txt
3. Load application
