# Welcome to SpotyQL

Welcome! This is our ultimate SQL project.

## Insights

We've decided to add a frontend interface, trying to merge all teachings we've gotten so far.

This project assembles together teachings from:
- introduction to CS (shoutout Alessio Martino)
- digital skills lab
- Databases & Big Data

## How to execute

There is no need to install dependencies or initialize virtual environments.

To execute the project, just load the 'startup.py' script as follows:

<code>python startup.py .env</code>

This command will
1. Initialize the venv inside folder '.env' (you can also specify any other name)
2. Install dependencies from application/requirements.txt
3. Load application

## Additional commentaries

Inside the root of this project, we've set up a configuration file.

This file presents a set of parameters that can be altered, in order to change the program's behaviour.

For performance purposes, the project has been initally created with sqlite3.
There is, in any case, an option to change such behaviour.

Inside configuration.json, look for "database". Inside such object, you'll find a parameter called "type".
Simply change this option to "mysql" and add the relative parameters (i.e. username, password and connection url) and run the application. This should alter the execution and load the database inside the given MySQL server.

## Navigating the frontend

This project features an interactive and dynamic frontend designed to provide a seamless user experience.

The interface is built to be intuitive, with a header navigation across all pages. The header includes a clickable logo for quick access to the home page and a navigation menu with links to key sections such as Home, Discover, Credits, Logger, and Console.

The Discover page provides an interactive environment for exploring SQL queries, with expandable boxes that reveal query details, descriptions, and results. Users can execute queries directly from the interface. 

The Credits page highlights the contributors behind the project and includes an overview of its purpose and goals.

The Logger page organizes log entries with timestamps and messages, offering a structured way to track system activities. 

The Console page allows users to input and execute custom queries via a search bar, enhancing the interactive experience.

## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Emergency Procedure

In case you encounter any error, or want to debug migrations, just send command

<code>python startup.py reset</code>

This will automatically RESET all instances of the database (both sqlite and mysql), and force the application to repeat data migrations.
