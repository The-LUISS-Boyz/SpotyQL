# Welcome to SpotyQL

Welcome! This is our ultimate SQL project.

## Insights

We've decided to add a frontend interface, trying to merge all teachings we've gotten so far.

This project assembles together teachings from:
- introduction to CS (shoutout Alessio Martino)
- digital skills lab
- Databases & Big Data

## How to execute

There is no need to install dependencies or initialize virtual environments.

The only requirement is Python 3.10 with venv installed.

Usually venv is installed by default in Python 3.10. If this is not the case, you can install it by running:

<code>python -m ensurepip</code>

This will install pip and venv.

To execute the project, just load the 'startup.py' script as follows:

<code>python startup.py .env</code>

This command will
1. Initialize the venv inside folder '.env' (you can also specify any other name)
2. Install dependencies from application/requirements.txt
3. Load application

## Additional commentaries

Inside the root of this project, we've set up a configuration file.

This file presents a set of parameters that can be altered, in order to change the program's behaviour.

For performance purposes, the project has been initally created with sqlite3.
There is, in any case, an option to change such behaviour.

Inside configuration.json, look for "database". Inside such object, you'll find a parameter called "type".
Simply change this option to "mysql" and add the relative parameters (i.e. username, password and connection url) and run the application. This should alter the execution and load the database inside the given MySQL server.

## Navigating the frontend

This project features an interactive and dynamic frontend designed to provide a seamless user experience.

The interface is built to be intuitive, with a header navigation across all pages. The header includes a clickable logo for quick access to the home page and a navigation menu with links to key sections such as Home, Discover, Credits, Logger, and Console.

The Discover page provides an interactive environment for exploring SQL queries, with expandable boxes that reveal query details, descriptions, and results. Users can execute queries directly from the interface. 

The Credits page highlights the contributors behind the project and includes an overview of its purpose and goals.

The Logger page organizes log entries with timestamps and messages, offering a structured way to track system activities. 

The Console page allows users to input and execute custom queries via a search bar, enhancing the interactive experience.

## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ Emergency Procedure

In case you encounter any error, or want to debug migrations, just send command

<code>python startup.py reset</code>

This will automatically RESET all instances of the database (both sqlite and mysql), and force the application to repeat data migrations.

## Code Navigation

This section will help navigating the codebase.

### Root Folder

The root folder contains the following files:
- `startup.py`: this is the entry point of the application. It will initialize the venv, install dependencies and load the application.
- `configuration.json`: this is the configuration file for the application. It contains a set of parameters that can be altered, in order to change the program's behaviour.

### Application Folder (application/)

This folder contains all the code relative to the backend application.

Some highlights:
- `main.py`: this is the main file of the application. It will load the application.
- `server.py`: this file contains the FastAPI server (for loading the frontend).
- `dataset/__loader__.py`: this file has multiple purposes:
  - loads the dataset
  - cleans the dataset
- `dataset/__functions__.py`: this file contains migration and population functions
- `sql/__mysql__.py`: this file contains the MySQL connection service
- `sql/__sqlite__.py`: this file contains the SQLite connection service

### SQL Folder (sql/)

This folder contains the SQL code.

Some highlights:
- `queries/`: this folder contains the SQL queries used by the application. Some notes:
  - all queries are stored in separate files
  - there are a few queries that have different implementations for SQLite and MySQL. Such files are suffixed by `.sqlite.sql` and `.mysql.sql` (e.g. `basic_track_info.sqlite.sql` and `basic_track_info.mysql.sql`)
- `migrations.sqlite.sql`: this file contains the SQL code to migrate the SQLite database.
- `migrations.mysql.sql`: this file contains the SQL code to migrate the MySQL database.

### Frontend Folder (frontend/)

This folder contains the frontend code. The application is a vanilla HTML + CSS + JS application.

### Utils Folder (utils/)

Util files used to explore the dataset at the very early stages of development.

## Final Remarks

"This project has been a challenge, but it gave us some great lessons. Even though the result is pretty good, I have personally learned to 'not overstep'. Taking on the project was a big assignment; adding a frontend, configuration and other sugar features has complicated things way more than expected."
